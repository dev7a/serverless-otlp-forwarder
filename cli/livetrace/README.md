# OTLP Stdout livetrace

`livetrace` is a command-line tool designed to enhance local development workflows when working with distributed tracing in serverless environments using the [Serverless OTLP Forwarder Architecture](https://dev7a.github.io/serverless-otlp-forwarder/architecture/).

## Overview

In the Serverless OTLP Forwarder architecture, Lambda functions (or other compute resources) emit OpenTelemetry (OTLP) trace data to standard output. This tool enables you to correlate and visualize complete tracesâ€”especially valuable during development. Because logs from different services involved in a single request may be distributed across multiple Log Groups, _livetrace_ can tail several log groups simultaneously and reconstruct traces spanning all participating services.

`livetrace` supports:

1.  **Discovering** relevant CloudWatch Log Groups based on naming patterns or CloudFormation stack resources.
2.  **Validating** the existence of these Log Groups, intelligently handling standard Lambda and Lambda@Edge naming conventions.
3.  **Tailing** or **Polling** these Log Groups simultaneously using either the `StartLiveTail`or the `FilterLogEvents` APIs.
4.  **Parsing** OTLP trace data embedded within log messages in the format produced by the _otlp-stdout-span-exporter_ ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dev7a/otlp-stdout-span-exporter), [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/otlp-stdout-span-exporter/), [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/otlp-stdout-span-exporter)).
5.  **Displaying** traces in a user-friendly waterfall view directly in your terminal, including service names, durations, and timelines.
6.  **Showing** span events associated with the trace.
7.  **Optionally forwarding** the raw OTLP protobuf data to a specified OTLP-compatible endpoint (like a local OpenTelemetry Collector or Jaeger instance).

It acts as a local observability companion, giving you immediate feedback on trace behavior without needing to navigate the AWS console, your o11y tool, or wait for logs to propagate fully to a backend system.

## Features

*   **CloudWatch Log Tailing:** Stream logs in near real-time using `StartLiveTail`.
*   **CloudWatch Log Polling:** Periodically fetch logs using `FilterLogEvents` with `--poll-interval`.
*   **Flexible Log Group Discovery:**
    *   Find log groups matching one or more patterns (`--log-group-pattern`).
    *   Find log groups belonging to a CloudFormation stack (`--stack-name`), including implicitly created Lambda log groups.
    *   **Combine pattern and stack discovery:** Use both options simultaneously to aggregate log groups.
*   **Support for Lambda@Edge:** Checks existence and handles Lambda@Edge naming conventions (`/aws/lambda/<region>.<function-name>`).
*   **OTLP/stdout Parsing:** Decodes trace data logged via the `otlp-stdout-span-exporter` format (JSON wrapping base64-encoded, gzipped OTLP protobuf).
*   **Console Trace Visualization:**
    *   Waterfall view showing span hierarchy, service names, durations, and relative timing.
    *   Display of span kind (SERVER, CLIENT, etc.) and important span attributes in the waterfall.
    *   Configurable color themes for better service differentiation (`--theme`, `--list-themes`).
*   **Console Event Display:** Lists span events with timestamps, service names, and optional attribute filtering including both event and related span attributes.
*   **OTLP Forwarding:** Optionally send processed trace data to an OTLP HTTP endpoint (`-e`, `-H`, Environment Variables).
*   **Configuration:**
    *   AWS Region/Profile support.
    *   OTLP endpoint and headers configurable via CLI args or standard OTel environment variables.
    *   Session timeout for Live Tail mode (`--session-timeout`).
    *   Configuration profiles (`.livetrace.toml`) for saving common settings (`--config-profile`, `--save-profile`).
*   **User Experience:**
    *   **Detailed Startup Preamble:** Shows a summary of the effective configuration (AWS details, discovery sources, modes, forwarding, display settings, log groups).
    *   **Interactive Spinner:** Displays a spinner while waiting for events.
    *   **Verbosity Control:** Adjust logging detail (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Rust toolchain (latest stable recommended). You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
*   AWS Credentials configured (via environment variables, shared credentials file, etc.) accessible to the tool, with permissions to read CloudWatch Logs and, if using stack discovery, CloudFormation resources.

### From Crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
cargo install livetrace
```

### From Source

If you want to build from the latest source code or contribute to development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dev7a/serverless-otlp-forwarder.git
    cd serverless-otlp-forwarder
    ```

2.  **Build and install the `livetrace` binary:**
    ```bash
    cargo install --path cli/livetrace
    ```
    This will compile the `livetrace` crate and place the binary in your Cargo bin directory (e.g., `~/.cargo/bin/livetrace`). Ensure this directory is in your system's `PATH`.

## Usage

```bash
livetrace [OPTIONS]
```

### Discovery Options (One or Both Required)

You must specify at least one of the following to identify the log groups. They can be used together:

*   `--log-group-pattern <PATTERN>...`: Discover log groups whose names contain *any* of the given patterns (case-sensitive substring search). Can be specified multiple times, or provide multiple patterns after the flag.
    ```bash
    # Single pattern
    livetrace --log-group-pattern "/aws/lambda/my-app-"
    # Multiple patterns
    livetrace --log-group-pattern "/aws/lambda/service-a-" "/aws/lambda/service-b-"
    livetrace --log-group-pattern "pattern1" --log-group-pattern "pattern2"
    ```
*   `--stack-name <STACK_NAME>`: Discover log groups associated with resources (`AWS::Logs::LogGroup`, `AWS::Lambda::Function`) in the specified CloudFormation stack.
    ```bash
    livetrace --stack-name my-production-stack
    ```
*   **Combining:**
    ```bash
    # Find groups in a stack AND those matching a pattern
    livetrace --stack-name my-api-stack --log-group-pattern "/aws/lambda/auth-"
    ```

### Mode Selection (Optional, Mutually Exclusive Group)

You can specify *at most one* of the following:

*   `--poll-interval <SECONDS>`: Use the `FilterLogEvents` API instead of `StartLiveTail`, polling every specified number of seconds.
    ```bash
    # Poll every 15 seconds
    livetrace --stack-name my-dev-stack --poll-interval 15
    ```
*   `--backtrace <DURATION>`: (Polling mode only) Fetch logs starting from `<DURATION>` ago (e.g., `30s`, `5m`, `120` for 120 seconds) for the initial poll. Subsequent polls fetch new logs.
    ```bash
    # Poll, fetching initial logs from the last 2 minutes
    livetrace --stack-name my-dev-stack --poll-interval 15 --backtrace 2m
    ```
*   `--session-timeout <MINUTES>`: (Default: 30) Automatically exit after the specified number of minutes. **Only applicable in Live Tail mode (when `--poll-interval` is *not* used).**
    ```bash
    # Use Live Tail, but exit after 60 minutes
    livetrace --pattern "my-service-" --session-timeout 60
    ```
[!NOTE]
> Live Tail mode is the default, but it's not free, at 1c/minute. For long sessions, it's probably better to use the `FilterLogEvents` API with a polling interval.

### OTLP Forwarding (Optional)

Configure forwarding to send traces to another OTLP receiver:

*   `-e, --otlp-endpoint <URL>`: The base HTTP URL for the OTLP receiver (e.g., `http://localhost:4318`). `/v1/traces` will be appended automatically if no path is present.
*   `-H, --otlp-header <KEY=VALUE>`: Add custom HTTP headers (e.g., for authentication). Can be specified multiple times.

**Environment Variables for Forwarding:**

You can also configure the endpoint and headers using standard OpenTelemetry environment variables. The precedence order is:

1.  Command-line arguments (`-e`, `-H`)
2.  Signal-specific environment variables (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS`)
3.  General OTLP environment variables (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`)

*   `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<URL>` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=<URL>`: Base URL for the receiver.
*   `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=<KEY1=VAL1,KEY2=VAL2...>` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS=<KEY1=VAL1,KEY2=VAL2...>`: Comma-separated list of key-value pairs for headers.

```bash
# Forward using CLI args
livetrace --stack-name my-stack -e http://localhost:4318 -H "Authorization=Bearer mytoken"

# Forward using environment variables
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4318
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-api-key=secret123,x-tenant-id=abc"
livetrace --stack-name my-stack
```

### Console Display Options (Optional)

Control the appearance of the console output:

*   `--theme <THEME>`: Select a color theme (e.g., `default`, `tableau`, `monochrome`). Default is `default`.
*   `--list-themes`: List all available color themes with descriptions and exit.
*   `--attrs <GLOB_LIST>`: Comma-separated list of glob patterns (e.g., `"http.*,db.statement,my.custom.*"`) to filter which attributes are displayed. Applied to both span attributes and event attributes. If omitted, all attributes are shown.
*   `--grep <REGEX>`: Filter spans and events displayed in the console. Only telemetry where at least one attribute *value* matches the provided Rust-compatible regular expression will be shown. Matching text within attribute values will be highlighted (yellow background) in the timeline log.
    ```bash
    # Show only telemetry where an attribute value contains "error" or "failure"
    livetrace --pattern "my-app" --grep "error|failure"
    ```
*   `--event-severity-attribute <ATTRIBUTE_NAME>`: (Default: `event.severity`) Specify the event attribute key used to determine the severity level for coloring event output.
*   `--events-only`: Only display events in the timeline log, hiding span start information.
*   `--trace-timeout <SECONDS>`: (Default: 5) Maximum time in seconds to wait for spans belonging to a trace before displaying/forwarding it, even if the root span hasn't been received.

### Other Options

*   `--aws-region <AWS_REGION>`: Specify the AWS Region. Defaults to environment/profile configuration.
*   `--aws-profile <AWS_PROFILE>`: Specify the AWS profile name.
*   `-v, -vv, -vvv`: Increase logging verbosity (Info -> Debug -> Trace). Internal logs go to stderr.
*   `--forward-only`: Only forward telemetry via OTLP; do not display traces/events in the console. Requires an endpoint to be configured.
*   `--config-profile <PROFILE_NAME>`: Load configuration from a named profile in `.livetrace.toml`.
*   `--save-profile <PROFILE_NAME>`: Save the current command-line arguments as a named profile in `.livetrace.toml`.

## Console Output

When running in console mode (`--forward-only` not specified), `livetrace` displays:

1.  **Configuration Preamble:** Shows a detailed summary of the effective configuration being used, including AWS details, discovery sources, mode, forwarding settings, display options, and the final list of log groups being monitored.
2.  **Spinner:** An animated spinner indicates when the tool is actively waiting for new log events.
3.  **Trace Waterfall:** For each trace received:
    *   A header `â”€ Trace ID: <trace_id> â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€`
    *   A table showing:
        *   Service Name
        *   Span Name (indented based on parent-child relationship)
        *   Span Kind (SERVER, CLIENT, etc.)
        *   Status (OK, ERROR)
        *   Duration (ms)
        *   Span ID (shortened to 8 characters)
        *   Timeline bar visualization (colored based on --color-by setting)
4.  **Timeline Log:** For each trace received:
    *   A header `â”€ Timeline Log for Trace: <trace_id> â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€` (or `â”€ Events for Trace: <trace_id> â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€` if `--events-only` is used)
    *   A chronological list of span starts and events showing:
        *   Timestamp (colored dimmed)
        *   Span ID (shortened to 8 characters, colored based on --color-by setting)
        *   Service Name (in square brackets)
        *   Type tag (`[SPAN]` or `[EVENT]`) - `[SPAN]` entries are hidden if `--events-only` is used
        *   Status/Level (colored appropriately: green for OK, red for ERROR, etc.)
        *   Name (Span name or Event name)
        *   Attributes (if present): filtered by `--attrs` if provided

## Configuration Profiles

`livetrace` supports saving and loading configuration profiles to reduce typing for frequently used commands. Profiles are stored in a `.livetrace.toml` file in the current directory.

### Saving a Profile

To save your current command-line options as a named profile:

```bash
# Save the current settings as "dev-profile"
livetrace --pattern "my-service-" --attrs "http.*" --save-profile dev-profile
```

### Using a Profile

To use a saved profile:

```bash
# Load settings from the "dev-profile"
livetrace --config-profile dev-profile
```

You can also override specific settings from the profile by providing additional command-line arguments:

```bash
# Load from profile but override the attribute filter
livetrace --config-profile dev-profile --attrs "db.*,aws.*"
```

### Configuration File Format

The `.livetrace.toml` file follows this structure:

```toml
version = 0.0

# Global settings applied to all profiles
[global]
aws-region = "us-east-1"
event-severity-attribute = "event.severity"

# Profile-specific settings
[profiles.dev-profile]
log-group-pattern = ["my-service-"]
attrs = "http.*"
theme = "solarized"
events-only = true
trace-timeout = 10

[profiles.prod-profile]
stack-name = "production-stack"
forward-only = true
otlp-endpoint = "http://localhost:4318"
```

This file is meant to be local to your project or environment and should typically not be committed to version control.

## Shell Completions

`livetrace` can generate shell completion scripts for Bash, Elvish, Fish, PowerShell, and Zsh.
This allows you to get command-line suggestions by pressing the Tab key.

To generate a script, use the `generate-completions` subcommand:

```bash
livetrace generate-completions <SHELL>
```

Replace `<SHELL>` with your desired shell (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`).

### Installation Examples

The exact installation method varies by shell. Here are some common examples:

**Bash:**

1.  Ensure you have `bash-completion` installed (often available via your system\'s package manager).
2.  Create the completions directory if it doesn\'t exist:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
    ```
3.  Generate the script and save it:
    ```bash
    livetrace generate-completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/livetrace
    ```
    You may need to restart your shell or source your `.bashrc` for changes to take effect.

**Zsh:**

1.  Create a directory for completions if you don\'t have one (e.g., `~/.zsh/completions`).
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
    ```
2.  Add this directory to your `fpath` in your `.zshrc` file *before* `compinit` is called:
    ```zsh
    # In ~/.zshrc
    fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
    # ... (ensure compinit is called after this, e.g., autoload -U compinit && compinit)
    ```
3.  Generate the script:
    ```bash
    livetrace generate-completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_livetrace
    ```
    You may need to restart your shell or run `compinit` again.

**Fish:**

1.  Create the completions directory if it doesn\'t exist:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
    ```
2.  Generate the script:
    ```bash
    livetrace generate-completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/livetrace.fish
    ```
    Fish should pick up the completions automatically on next launch.

Refer to your shell\'s documentation for the most up-to-date and specific instructions.

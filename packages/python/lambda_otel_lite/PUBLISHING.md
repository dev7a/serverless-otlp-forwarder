3. Run quality checks:
   ```bash
   pytest
   mypy src/lambda_otel_lite
   ruff check
   ruff format
   ```
4. Clean build:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info/
   python -m build
   ```
5. Test the build:
   ```bash
   python -m venv test_venv
   source test_venv/bin/activate
   pip install dist/*.whl
   pytest  # Run tests with installed package
   deactivate
   rm -rf test_venv
   ```
6. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -am "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
7. Publish to PyPI:
   ```bash
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```
8. Verify package on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/lambda-otel-lite/

## Post-Publishing
- [ ] Verify package installation works: `pip install lambda_otel_lite`
- [ ] Verify documentation appears correctly on PyPI
- [ ] Verify all package files are included
- [ ] Test the package in a new project
- [ ] Update any dependent packages
- [ ] Verify examples work with the published version

## Common Issues to Check
- Missing files in the published package
- Incorrect Python version requirements
- Missing type hints or stub files
- Broken links in documentation
- Incorrect version numbers
- Missing changelog entries
- Unintended breaking changes
- Incomplete or incorrect package metadata

## Notes
- Always use `python -m build` to build both wheel and sdist
- Use `twine check dist/*` to verify package metadata before uploading
- Test the package in a clean virtual environment before publishing
- Consider the impact on dependent packages
- Make sure all required files are included in the package (check MANIFEST.in if needed)
- Verify that the package works with the minimum supported Python version
- Consider testing on multiple operating systems if possible
- Remember to update any related documentation or examples in the main repository
